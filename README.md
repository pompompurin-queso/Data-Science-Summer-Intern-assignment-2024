# Data-Science-Summer-Intern-assignment-2024

The project includes:
- An EDA analysis to the Wolt courier partners dataset.
- 2 models: LTSM and Random Forest to predict the courier partners online based on 3 weather data points as input features: temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation.

- Dataset used: https://github.com/woltapp/data-science-internship-2024/blob/main/daily_cp_activity_dataset.csv

The project aims to add these further developments in the future:
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore with different feature selection.
- Explore the dataset as a time series with ARIMA.
- Examine the model more and understand the steps it took to reach to the prediction.

How to Install and Run the Project:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook your_project.ipynb
   Run each cell in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
or

2. Open and run on Google Colab.
